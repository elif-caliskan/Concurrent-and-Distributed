GameLife project is the implementation of the given game. First, according to the arguments, the dimensions are assigned. Then matrice is read from file if 
the path exists in arguments. Else the matrice is filled randomly with 0s and 1s. Then the neighbor count is computed and given conditions are applied. 
Then the result is printed to the console.

How to run: in edit configuration in eclipse arguments are written in the order of
row-count column-count max-generation <path of matrix1>(optional)
