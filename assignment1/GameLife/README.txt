MatrixMultiplication project is used for matrix multiplication. First it reads the files whose paths are given in arguments. 
Then it fills the corresponding matrices. Then in a for loop it iterates through every value of result matrix and finds its value by adding the 
multiplication of kth row of first matrix and kth column of second matrix. Then the result is printed to the console and given file.

How to run: in edit configuration in eclipse arguments are written in the order of
<path of matrix1> <path of matrix2> <path of result>

Contents of each file:
row-count   column-count
matrix according to rows and columns
